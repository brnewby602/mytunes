Notes

AppModel.js is the model class for the whole app, connects to AppView.js
  - initializes a SongQueue collection and a currentSong Song Model

In AppView:
  this.libraryView = new LibraryView({collection: this.model.get('library')});  
    library does not seem to be defined in AppModel.js
      ANSWER: library is passed in on construction of AppModel in index.html


SongsQueue.js
  extends Songs collection, doesn't look to be working as we dont see a queue when
    rendering index.html




SongQueueView and SongQueueEntryView are not referenced any where outside of Spec files

LibraryEntryView is what creates the rows under Library header (i.e.  (Artist) Song Name

LibraryView
  unsure why it is doing a detach on LibraryEntryView elements versus a remove


HOW PLAY WORKS

AppModel takes a library as a constructor argument
  in initialize(), it creates a 'play' event handler whose callback takes a song and sets the AppModel's current song to that song

When a SongQueueEntryView is clicked, it should call its model's 'play' method - here, the model is a Song model
  inside the 'play' method, a trigger() is called which fires an event handler for anyone who is listening



to enqueue

  - we need to add a method to SongQueueView called addSong (or similar) to be called from AppView by a click handler


  end of night question:

  why doesn't the AppView event handler for add:songQueue fire (line 15) ?
